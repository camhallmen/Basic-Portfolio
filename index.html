    <p>
        On August 14th, 2018, I began my journey into Web Development. I'm only a few days in, but have already gained an immense ammount of knowledge in this craft. <br>
        I will continue this course and secure what I hope to be a huge career and quality of life change. I can't wait to list out a wealth of expertise and certificatioins <br>
        here but until then, I can tell you a little about what I've accomplished so far. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2013, I graduated with an Associate's Degree from the Acadamy of Contemporary Music at the University of Central Oklahoma. Quite a mouthful for a useless <br>
        academic accomplishment. I had dreams of creating a new heavy metal band and touring the world. I moved to Colorado in pursuit of a good job with which I could <br>
        gain finances to acrue the music equipment I would need to create such a project. After a while, the job fell through and I was nowhere closer to achieving my goals <br>
        About that same time, two of my old friends stopped by on a cross-country trip to Florida. They were moving there to start a new business, and a new band. They spent <br>
        all day telling me about the music opportunities that could only be found in the state, and said I should join them somday. Someday ended up coming the following week.
    </p>

    <p>
        I sold my car, hopped into a moving truck and left Colorado. Two days later, I found myself in Florida surrounded by friends and with about twenty five cents in my pocket. <br>
        We then began the journey of finding new jobs, new places to live and most importantly, new music opportunities. We lived in a warehouse attatched to a friend's business for <br>
        almost a year. In that time, we were able to make enough money to secure some good-quality gear and an apartment. After multiple failed bands, I ended up playing bass with my <br>
        friends in On Letting Go. We played all over Florida in this band, and even got a few chances to play sold-out shows with big names in the industry. During this time, I was <br>
        able to work my up to Store Manager at the retail location where I was employed. On Letting Go eventually disbanded, and that brings me to the current day, where I sit at my <br>
        computer with high hopes for the future!
